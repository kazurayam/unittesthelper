=== Example-A5 Want to resolve the project directory via classpath of a class under the "build/classes/java/main" directory

As shown in the Example-A2, the `ProjectDirectoryResolver` knows  the `build/classes/java/test/` as a registered "Code Source Path Element under project directory" as default. But it does not know the `build/classes/java/main/`. Now I want to resolve the project directory via classpath of my `build/classes/java/main/com/example/App.class`. How can I do it?

Yes, you can do it. See the following code example.

Please find how the `CodeSourcePathELementsUnderProjectDirectory` class is used in the `com.example.App` class.
